### Starter

Today I have phone interview with MicroSoft on SDET and am noticed to attend onsite interview in coming days.

I have been failing since Chinese New Year, every interviews.

Here is the process:
1. Self introduce;
2. Write a program to reverse number characters during scanning one string unless occurred blank. e.g. "Hello Worlds" reverse 3 should return "leHlo roWsld";
3. (I used one stack to store ) How to implement without other temp stack;
4. How to test? Why use this case?
5. What do you know about SDET?
6. Q & A.

Tips:
Interviwer was very kind and friendly during the whole procedure, he may give some advices and challenges during my programming, and he always performed right. Be positive, be communicator and be creative.
More preparation, never enough. In fact this question is not in my plan, I have scanned lots info on internet without this.

Next:
- Read the documents in tips and note;
- Enhance algorithm;
- Enhance testing concept and method.
