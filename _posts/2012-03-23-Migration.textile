23 Mar 2012 - Shanghai, China

About.Me global pages always occurred CSS and directionry missing issue, so I decided to migrate to Hawktc.Github.Com repo to have a try. Result shows this works. Check the URL of About.Me repo, the directionry will change when redirect to other pages not under root. I still cannot find a way to resolve it. So I will keep this repo to check if someday I can fix it.

This weekend I have some tasks to finish:
# Update my CV;
# Learn Java Core;
# Prepare some interview questions and answers.

God bless kids with dream.
